    Adult Body Mass Index Calculator         
Filename:
    bmi_cal.py
Problem Statement:
    Assuming your weight in kilogram and height in meters  
    Calculate your BMI value and print it ?
    Take the height and weight of the user from input 
Hint: 
    How to caltulate your BMI ?
    Divide your weight in kilograms (kg) by your height in metres (m)
    Then divide the answer by your height again to get your BMI

This would be helpful since you need to convert your own height into meters 
    1 Feet = 0.3048 m
    1 Inch = 0.0254 m
